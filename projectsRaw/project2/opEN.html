        <h3>orginal idea</h3>
        <p>and so one later i also changed the checkpoints to a new system from an youtube tutorial and also i got to heard that the name didnt match the game on this point it has almost 30 levels firstly i has a good idea in mind where you come in like an building and needs to find a way out but so on i decided with that to make it so there diferent themes and each time you completed a theme obby you come in a building or somthing where you need to find a way out to go to the next theme  </p>
        <ul> a list of all themed obbies
            <li>tutorial
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        this a normal obby where it started with there also are prompts telling you the base principes also non needed cuz most users know how it work but also for the beginners thats way i made a toggler for it
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>gold monny and more
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        a obby in the colors yellow and green (not the (nl - the hague) footbal club collors but yellow from gold and green from monny)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
